# IFT6758 - Milestone 3

### Conda 

Conda uses the provided `environment.yml` file.
You can ignore `requirements.txt` if you choose this method.
Make sure you have [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) installed on your system.
Once installed, open up your terminal (or Anaconda prompt if you're on Windows).
Install the environment from the specified environment file:

    conda env create --file environment.yml
    conda activate B10-Milestone3

After you install, register the environment so jupyter can see it:

    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=B10-ift6758-conda-env

You should now be able to launch jupyter and see your conda environment:

    jupyter-lab

If you make updates to your conda `environment.yml`, you can use the update command to update your existing environment rather than creating a new one:

    conda env update --file environment.yml    

You can create a new environment file using the `create` command:

    conda env export > environment.yml

### Pip + Virtualenv

An alternative to Conda is to use pip and virtualenv to manage your environments.
This may play less nicely with Windows, but works fine on Unix devices.
This method makes use of the `requirements.txt` file; you can disregard the `environment.yml` file if you choose this method.

Ensure you have installed the [virtualenv tool](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) on your system.
Once installed, create a new virtual environment:

    vitualenv ~/ift6758-venv
    source ~/ift6758-venv/bin/activate

Install the packages from a requirements.txt file:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

As before, register the environment so jupyter can see it:

    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=ift6758-venv

You should now be able to launch jupyter and see your conda environment:

    jupyter-lab

If you want to create a new `requirements.txt` file, you can use `pip freeze`:

    pip freeze > requirements.txt

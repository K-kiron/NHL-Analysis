## RUNNING FLASK APP

To use the Flask app (`../Milestone3/serving/app.py`), you must:

1. Take care to insert COMET_API_KEY in `app.py` (`api = API(api_key="example_key_1234")`)
2. Open terminal and cd to `../Milestone3/serving/` and run `python app.py`
3. To access endpoints `/logs`, `/download_registry_model`, or `/predict`, open a new terminal and follow the subsequent instructions
4. To get `/logs`, run `curl http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT/logs`
5. To load a model (either from Comet or locally from `.pkl` file stored in `../../serving/`), run `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"workspace": "ift6758b-project-b10", "model": "MODEL_NAME", "version": "NUMBER.NUMBER.NUMBER", "experiment_key": "example-key-1234"}' http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT/download_registry_model`. Note that all the comet retrieval info can be stored in a `.json` file (stored in `/serving`) and you can run the command using this json file `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" â€”d @FILENAME.json http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT/download_registry_model`. 
6. To obtain a model prediction from a model downloaded from COMET or loaded locally using Flask app inside of a Jupyter notebook, add the following cell:
```
X = pd.DataFrame_input_df()
r = requests.post(
    "http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT/predict", 
    json=json.loads(X.to_json())
)
```
7. To obtain a model prediction from a model downloaded from COMET or loaded locally using Flask app directly from the terminal, run `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @JSON_FILENAME.json http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT/predict`. Note that JSON_FILENAME.json must be specified.
